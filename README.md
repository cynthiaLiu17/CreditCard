# CreditCard
This is a credit card validator, encryptor and decryptor created in C# on Visual Studio 2008 Form Application. Q1 was an assignment from computer science class, to simply to convert the inputted credit card integers to chars.
Q2 I expanded on the assignment and used Luhn's algorithm to validate the credit card and display information about the credit card. I also implemented simple encryption and decryption.
